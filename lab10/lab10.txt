Write the exact packet capture filter expressions to accomplish the following:

Capture all TCP traffic to/from Gmail, during the time when you log in to your Gmail account
Capture all HTTP traffic to/from Gmail, when you log in to your Gmail account
Find a popular YouTube video and play it while capturing all traffic to/from YouTube
After you run Wireshark with the above capture filters and collect the data, do the following:

Write a DISPLAY filter expression to count all TCP packets (captured under item #1) that have the flags SYN, PSH, and RST set. Show the fraction of packets that had each flag set.
Use a DISPLAY filter expression to separate the packets sent by your computer vs. received from Gmail and YouTube in items #2 and #3 above. Show the fractions for each type.
